# DappCamp Warriors

This repo contains a step by step walkthrough towards a production-ready dApp that combines an NFT collection, an ERC20 token, and DeFi.

## Repo structure

If you take a look of the existing branches, you'll see that there's multiple numbered branches. They build on top of each other, starting from `0-overview` (the one you're in, right now).

Each branch has its own readme, like this one, with an overview of the progress made towards the final dApp.

## dApp overview

Some of the topics we'll cover in this walkthrough are:

* Building an [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) (non-fungible) token.
* Building an [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) (fungible) token.
* Creating a staking contract (DeFi).
* Testing.
* Deploying contracts.
* Gas optimization.
* Security.
* Interacting with your contracts from the browser.
