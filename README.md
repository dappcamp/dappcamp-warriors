# DappCamp Warriors

This repo contains a step by step walkthrough towards a fully fledged dApp that combines an NFT collection, an ERC20 token, and DeFi.

## Repo structure

If you take a look of the existing branches, you'll see that there's multiple numbered branches. They build on top of each other, starting from `0-overview` (the one you're in, right now).

Each branch has its own readme, like this one, with an overview of the progress made towards the final dApp.

Also, if you go to the [pull requests](https://github.com/dappcamp/dappcamp-warriors/pulls), every branch has a PR
to the previous one, which is useful to see the [diff](https://github.com/dappcamp/dappcamp-warriors/pull/2/files).
