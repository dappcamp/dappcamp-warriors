In the context of crypto, staking can be defined as holding an asset to get rewards in exchange, you can read more [here](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-staking).

In this branch, we'll work on a staking contract that locks NFTs and gives ERC20 rewards.

There's two important new files: [contracts/Staking.sol](contracts/Staking.sol) and [test/Staking.spec.ts](test/Staking.spec.ts), like always, they have explanatory comments.
